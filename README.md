# Neighborhood Prime Labeling
This repository contains code for anything related to neighborhood-prime labeling.

The python file check_npl.py will go through all of the graphs provided to it and determine if their are neighborhood-prime. 
The graphs currently provided in this file are from Brendan McKay's website http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/graphs.html.

Here is a description of the graphs in this folder:
graph2.g6 (all simple graphs on 2 vertices)
graph3.g6 (all simple graphs on 3 vertices)
graph4.g6 (all simple graphs on 4 vertices)
graph5.g6 (all simple graphs on 5 vertices)
graph6.g6 (all simple graphs on 6 vertices)
graph7.g6 (all simple graphs on 7 vertices)
graph8.g6 (all simple graphs on 8 vertices)
graph9.g6 (all simple graphs on 9 vertices)
graph10.g6 (all simple graphs on 10 vertices)
